This is the second project for the basics of programming course I did in my first term during my Informatics studies at the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. This is a simple reproduction of [the Spy Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_Hunter) arcade game.

It has implemented
- Graphics
- Player movement with acceleration/deacceleration
- Keeping the score
- Saving and restoring game state
- Changing the width of the road
- Pausing the game

The project was made using Visual Studio 2019 and can be opened by opening the .sln file in the main directory.
Enjoy!
